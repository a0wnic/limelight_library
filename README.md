# limelight_library
A simple library to help make cleaner calls to the Limelight.<br/>
![I know this is in robotcontainer and I am not supposed to do that, but I needed a quick place to put it anyways.](ex.gif)

# How to use:
1. Clone repository into robot project you want.
2. In robot code: make a reference to limelight(); 
3. Use limelight.get**(); or limelight.set**(); to get or set NT values.

By default, the name is "limelight", however it can be changed by appending a string to the contructor.

This is an example robot project that uses the LimelightLibrary: https://github.com/fearxzombie/limelight_library_Example
